# User Stories

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

As a user, I want to log in to the application and have a personalized experience of the application. This means that my collection of flashcards may be different to other users' flashcards.

When logged in, I want to create, view, update and delete flashcards. After creating a flashcard, I want to group
several flashcards together to form a quiz; a collection of flashcards.

Furthermore, I want to be able to exit the application and log in to continue where I left off. This means that the
quizzes and flashcards are stored persistently.

## Improvements and future functionality

As a user, I want to search and filter quizzes for easier and more intuitive navigation.

As a user, I want to see how many flashcards I answered correctly the first time.

Additionally, default quizzes are added to each user when a user successfully registers, such that a user can try out the full functionality of the Cognition application at once.
